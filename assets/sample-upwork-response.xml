				<![CDATA[Summary рџ’Є<br />
We are a 100% remote and international digital agency. For the last seven years, we&#039;ve been successfully operating in the web design, development and branding world. <br /><br />
However, in the last six months, we&#039;ve open a subsidiary and expanded into short-form CGI/mixed reality videos - specifically in the MENA, Europe and North America regions. <br /><br />
We&#039;re now looking to expand our sales team with a sharp, friendly, and proactive inbound SDR/sales consultant to take discovery calls and sell our services to leads.<br /><br />
Job Responsibilities рџ¤ќ<br />
All our leads are inbound inquiries/hot leads from Instagram and email. You will be required to speak with leads - that are excited to work with us - and be their personal guide. This will entail gathering information via discovery emails/calls, asking intelligent and dynamic questions (list available), determining costs/timelines with the Efir team via Slack, and then creating a proposal from a template for the lead to review. If all goes well, the client comes on board and you hand them over to one of our Project Manager&#039;s to start the project.<br /><br />
Our leads are predominantly from GCC countries (mainly UAE and KSA). We also have occasional leads from Europe and USA (East and West Coast).<br /><br />
99% of the work will be online/laptop based, but if there are leads that would like to meet in person (eg. in Dubai), we&#039;d love to know if you&#039;d be up for that.<br /><br />
You&#039;ll need to have вњ…<br />
- Great organization and time management (you&#039;ll be working on up to 10 leads at once, but we&#039;ll start off with just a few to warm up)<br />
- Excellent and clear communication (written and spoken) in English (Arabic and Russian is a BIG plus!)<br />
- Even better listening skills (understanding client needs/problems and asking thoughtful questions)<br />
- Ability to learn and follow internal processes <br />
- Provide clear progress updates and reports to Head of Sales<br />
- A good sense of humor and working attitude (we&#039;re here to do good work but life is about having fun too!)<br /><br />
It&#039;ll be great if you also have рџ”Ґ<br />
- Experience in web design/development/branding/video/animation processes<br />
- An eye for design and good presentation<br />
- Proactive suggestions to improve the current sales cycle<br /><br />
Tools You&#039;ll Be Using рџ’»<br />
- Gmail<br />
- Pipedrive (CRM)<br />
- WhatsApp Business (For some lead conversations)<br />
- Slack (For internal comms)<br />
- Zoom (Calls)<br />
- Google Sheets (Note-taking)<br />
- Pitch (Proposals)<br /><br />
Additional clauses рџ’µ<br />
We&#039;re open to working with you on an hourly base rate + commission or a higher commission-only basis.<br /><br />

				<![CDATA[Hi Shaun,<br /><br />
My name is Sierra Laflamme and I am a Project Manager with Lux Manufacturing Group in Vancouver, Canada. We design and install interiors for senior living communities across the United States.<br /><br />
We are looking for someone to visit a few sites (it will be four in total over the next few months) in the Bend, OR area to make some simple CAD drawings with accompanying photos for us. Our requirements vary from site to site but if you are interested I could send you the details for our first two jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are existing senior living communities that we are renovating and where we are missing certain pieces of information. For example, our first site we have decent overall floor plans but need elevations for a few walls and columns in six rooms to help us install new millwork. Details needed would include location of electrical and water connection points and existing millwork that we will be replacing, as well as mouldings, window frames, or pilasters that we would need to work around. The second project we don&#039;t even have decent floor plans and would need overall floor plans as well, but in a much smaller space.<br /><br />
The timeline would kind of be a as soon as we can kind of thing. <br /><br />
Please reach out if you think this is a job you would be interested in doing for us! I have drawings I can share with you that show in detail the scope of work involved.<br /><br />
Thanks for your time!<br /><br />

				<![CDATA[We need a 3d model produced and rigged of an anthropomorphic cartoon bunny/rabbit. We already have a 2D version of the character but require a 3d model capable of being used for animation and possibly to create printed 3d models and/or as a guideline for stuffed animals. We don&#039;t have any requirements for any particular software to be used. We would like to see a rough design before giving the go ahead for completion. We would need to have the character look exactly like the 2D version, just in 3D. <br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $300

				<![CDATA[We are interested in creating a platform that would allow the user to build and design shadow boards online in - similar to the many room or house design platforms. <br /><br />
The closest thing that I&rsquo;ve seen to make a comparison is planner5d.com (please note that we require a much simpler platform). Please see attached screenshots. We want it simple and easy for the user to navigate and design with drag and drop functionality.<br /><br />
All tools, hooks, and holders, etc. would be available via the side panel. In addition, templates would be accessible for the user to simplify the process. <br /><br />
Core Functionality of Custom Shadow Board Creator Tool:<br />
1.Overall Board Background Design Color (Solid colors / specific brand colors / ASP Design Team Create)<br />
2.Tool Shadow Type (Outline Shadows / Solid Shadows of tools)<br />
3.Tool Shadow Colors<br />
4.Client Logo Location (Top left / top right / center of board)<br />
5.What type of hooks/holders required (Stainless steel push thru hook system / Standard plastic screw mounted hook system / Stainless steel screw mounted hook system)<br />
6.Board Style (Wall Mount / Mobile / Stationary Stand / Magnet Mounted)<br />
7.Board Material (StorShield / StorLam / StorClear / StorShield+ / StorLaze)<br />
8.Board Title &amp;amp; Subtitle (*optional fields)<br />
9.Board Size selector (width x height)<br />
10.Quantity of Board(s)<br />
11.Select Tools from tool bank<br />
12.Request a custom tool<br /><br />
The program would be accessible via any medium and would also be incorporated into our website as well (website will soon be under construction and will be built on Wordpress)<br /><br />
Please submit proposals that include cost, timeline, and availability.<br /><br />
Thank you.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$40.00

				<![CDATA[What we are<br /><br />
We are ALMA, an innovative platform dedicated to mental and emotional well-being in workplace settings. Our ALMA App provides specialized tools and resources to enhance the emotional health of employees in large and multinational companies. We focus on creating a healthier and more productive work environment by monitoring stress, managing anxiety, and fostering well-being practices. We&#039;re seeking an experienced 3D Artist to bring life to our charming fairy-style character and design a user interface that complements our vision of promoting mental health in the workplace.<br /><br />
Responsibilities:<br /><br />
Design and create a high-quality fairy-style character for the ALMA App, captivating and in line with the application&#039;s visual aesthetic.<br />
Develop smooth and expressive animations for the character, bringing life and energy to user interaction.<br />
Design and develop the 3D user interface, maintaining aesthetic coherence and functionality.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br /><br />
Demonstrable experience in 3D character creation for video games or interactive applications.<br />
Proficiency in 3D modeling and animation software like Maya, Blender, ZBrush, etc.<br />
Ability to work within tight deadlines without compromising work quality.<br />
Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams.<br /><br />
Attachments<br />
In the attachment we put a reference that we have developed in Midjourney, however it is too realistic, the idea is something more stylized, simpler with a corporate focus. But I think it can undoubtedly work as an initial idea, even the character does not necessarily need a mouth and in this way we reduce expressions to communicate. The character does occupy some iddle animations, of movements referring to a response to what the user does in the app. We will provide you with the information on the screens of the entire app in figma, the idea is that the character and its design are consistent with the design of the interface. of the app.<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $2,000

				<![CDATA[Hello!<br /><br />
I am looking for somebody to complete a basic model (no finishes required) of a house on SketchUp. I am an interior designer who would like to see the layout of the interior of the home in a 3D view. Would you require just the SketchUp file of the completed model.<br /><br />

			<description>
				<![CDATA[We are a digital branding agency based in Brussels, specializing in web development. We are currently seeking a long-term partner for 3D modeling and rendering. Our work incorporates WebGL technologies, as well as pre-rendering solutions for scrolling pages.<br /><br />
This initial assignment aims to assess the contractor&#039;s skills in a real-world environment. It involves an existing client but is a pilot project that will not be published.<br /><br />
We have already designed the webpage and outlined the scenario. It&#039;s a product landing page, with each section highlighting a benefit of the product. The product is an industrial air filter, unique for its ability to be changed without altering its structure, making it less bulky and more eco-friendly. For a detailed explanation of the product, please refer to this video&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.deltrian.com/lfc (link to understand the product).<br /><br />
You can see an example of the technique and technology we use here:<br />
https://fasterdisplays.com/fr/exhibitor<br /><br />
The idea is to create an animation (video) triggered by scrolling at a specific timestamp. Here is the background video: https://fasterdisplays.com/videos/exhibitor/desktop/expositor3.mp4 (Example of expected finish)<br /><br />
Another example: https://www.hyperframe.com/.<br /><br />
**Attention**<br />
It is important that the product appears as realistic as possible, with precise physics, texture, and motion. The elements are organic, comprising filter media and plastic (hence imperfections and variations).<br /><br />
**Scenario**<br />
The site will feature 5 sections/keyframes (benefits):<br />
1. Pocket Filter (Packshot)<br />
2. Slight pullback of the product<br />
3. Frame removal (animation of elasticity gripping and releasing the frame)<br />
4. Folding of the filter (highlighting its volume)<br />
5. Insertion into a vacuum bag (animation of the bag retracting)<br /><br />
**Deliverables**<br />
A video of approximately 30 seconds at 120 or 60 fps. The timing should be adjusted according to the keyframes of the page.<br /><br />
**Page Design + Scenario**<br />
(see attached)<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $1,500

Task 1: Departures flicker board video file, this is bespoke with text and information we will provide when working on the job. This just needs to be a video file that will repeat (8-10 second clip estimate maximum)<br /><br />
Task 2: Video file starting with a map of subway/or area, zooming in on a location and then looking like were transported to that location displaying images / video from that location. (8-10 second clip estimate maximum)<br /><br />
Task 3: Dress movement PNG video (no background) on a static image of a female, very similar to attached (more detailed briefing to follow) (2-3 second clip estimate, repeated)<br /><br />
Task 4: Specific shaped gobo lighting moving around area on a few interior spaces we have modelled in blender. This can be over an existing video render we can produce or within our 3D model (preferred but not essential, doing this within a blender model)<br /><br />
There may be a few other tasks to help with if timings align. <br />

				<![CDATA[Looking for someone to take images of homes and convert them to digital images that look like watercolor paintings. Will need someone with a bit of skill to add/remove parts of the images like cars, trees, bushes, convert snow to grass, etc. as not all the pictures will be perfect. For example sometimes a tree is covering the front entrance/door or a nice window and it would look better to be removed.<br /><br />
We will need the digital image in order to print them at a local print shop to deliver to our clients.<br /><br />
The hope is we find someone that can produce these nice looking images on n ongoing basis, likely 1-2 per week so there is a continuation of work to be had. <br /><br />
I&#039;ve attached some samples our previous artist was producing, she has changed careers so in need of someone new!<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $40
